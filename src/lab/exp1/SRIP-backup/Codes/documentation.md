# Experiment Code Documentation 

## Introduction

### Project
* #### Domain Name :soil mechanics and foundation engineering
* #### Lab Name :  Soil Mechanics
* #### Experiment Name : Water content of soil.

The water content (w) is also called natural water content or natural moisture
content is the ratio of the weight of water to the weight of the solids in a given mass of
soil. This ratio is usually expressed as percentage.
In almost all soil tests natural moisture content of the soil is to be determined.
The knowledge of the natural moisture content is essential in all studies of soil
mechanics. To sight a few, natural moisture content is used in determining the bearing
capacity and settlement. The natural moisture content will give an idea of the state of
soil in the field.

### Purpose of the project
The purpose of the project is to convert the Water Content experiment simulation from Flash to Javascript. 

# Technologies and Libraries 
### Technologies :
	 HTML
	 CSS
	 Javascript
### Libraries : 
	 P5.Js

# Code Details 
	File Name : newnewmain.js
	File Description : Javascript file using p5.js library.

### Function : draw()
	Function Description : draws pictures on screen
	Loops until window is open.

### Function : setup()
	Function Description : declaring variables
	Setting up the animation.

### Function : windowResized()
	Function Description : Dynamic changes in canvas length and breadth. 


### Function : ellipse()
	Function Description : draws ellipse on screen
	ellipse(x,y,minor_a,minor_b);

## Development Environment
	OS : ARCH LINUX.
	TextEditor: Sublime text.

## Process Followed to convert the experiment 
	1) Understand the assigned Flash simulation
	2) Understanding the experiment concept
	3) Re-implement the same in P5.js.

## Risks and Issues :
	1) Understanding object oriented programming.
	2) Resizing functionality
	3) Working with objects and Methods.
	4) Accomodating for various browsers.

## Other details:
	For many soils, the water content may be an extremely important index used for
	establishing the relationship between the way a soil behaves and its properties. The
	consistency of a fine-grained soil largely depends on its water content. The water
	content is also used in expressing the phase relationships of air, water, and solids in a
	given volume of soil.
	Soil mass is generally a three phase system. It consists of solid particles, liquid
	and gas. For all practical purposes, the liquid may be considered to be water (although
	in some cases, the water may contain some dissolved salts) and the gas as air. The
	phase system may be expressed in SI units either in terms of mass-volume or weight-
	volume relationships. The inter relationships of the different phases are important since
	they help to define the condition or the physical make-up of the soil.
